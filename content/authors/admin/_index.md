I am currently preparing my future M.Sc. studies.

I attained my Bachelor’s Degree in Statistics after studying at University of Padua. My academic career did not begin directly studying the data, but I dawned with the study of Physical Education and Sport Science. I discovered Statistics by chance, since it was a topic of one course. This course completely altered my viewpoint as I was compelled by its power, by the advantages that it could give me and its versatility. Thus, I decided to change city, University and degree program and I begun studying Statistics at the University of Padua.
